# ActorsWorkshopWebsite

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

This project is a volunteer effort for a friend's Actor's Workshop. This website will display information gathered from their social media and calendar and be used to advertise the workshop.

This website is being done fully from the frontend and has no custom API package to make it as lightweight as possible. It will use third party APIs to gather the necessary information and display properly. To keep keys secure, the website implements Doppler to store them preventing API key exposure.

This is still currently being built and has not been launched. When it is, there will be an update to the read me with a link to the website.
